# MEM AEAD Source Code Package

## About
The specification of the MEM family of AEAD schemes can be found on [ePrint](TODO). This repository provides implementations for the following ciphers:

* **MRO:** fully misuse-resistant, high-performance, based on the tweakable Masked Even-Mansour (MEM) block cipher
* **MRS:** fully misuse-resistant, high-performance, based on the Sponge construction
* **OPP:** nonce-respecting, high-performance, based on the tweakable Masked Even-Mansour (MEM) block cipher

All schemes leverage a round-reduced [BLAKE2](https://blake2.net/) permutation.
